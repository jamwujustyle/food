    "autobiography": "I’m Zhamshid Abdulazizov, a student who grew up in Kazakhstan, where meals were as much about conversation and family rituals as about eating. I remember the long weekends when my family gathered around beshbarmak or baursaks, debating flavors, sharing stories, and sometimes playfully arguing over who added too much salt. From those moments, I realized that food is a lens for understanding people—what they value, how they remember, and how they connect. Cooking became my way to explore these dynamics personally: experimenting with traditional Kazakh dishes, introducing subtle twists, and seeing how friends respond. This curiosity led me to notice how recipes, ingredients, and preparation styles carry identity, memory, and social meaning.",
    "reflection": {
      "keyLearnings": "One key lesson I took from this course is that food is a map of culture, identity, and power. I learned that globalization and migration don’t just spread dishes—they reshape them. A dish from Kazakhstan, for example, can appear differently abroad, acquiring new meanings while still carrying a trace of its origin. I also noticed how language frames food: the way people name dishes, describe flavors, or tell cooking stories preserves identity and transmits memory across generations. Understanding these patterns revealed that even everyday meals are embedded in larger social and cultural systems.",
      "motto": "“Every dish carries a story.” This reminds me that cooking is more than technique; it’s communication. A family recipe, a street snack, or a holiday feast reflects history, relationships, and personal choices. Paying attention to these stories has deepened my appreciation for both my own roots and other cultures.",
      "applyingThemes": "I plan to apply these insights by observing how people use food to express identity and memory. At home, I’ll pay attention to how recipes evolve across generations; in my academic work, I’ll explore how dishes travel and adapt while retaining cultural significance. Food, for me, will remain a way to connect with others, uncover hidden histories, and understand culture in its lived, flavorful form."

Throughout my academic journey, I have become increasingly fascinated by how food tells stories about migration, belonging, and memory. Growing up in a multicultural environment has made me curious about the invisible ties between language and everyday practices such as cooking and eating.\nI enjoy exploring how people preserve their traditions through food and how new cultural identities emerge when recipes and languages travel across borders. This curiosity inspired me to study topics related to globalization and cultural exchange. Beyond academics, I value creativity, teamwork, and learning from different perspectives. I believe that food, like language, is a living form of expression that reflects who we are and where we come from.

It’s not only about taste, but also about remembering where we come from.",

In my future studies or career, I plan to continue examining how cultural exchange through food can build understanding between different communities. Food connects people beyond borders, and I believe that by studying these connections, we can promote empathy and appreciation for diversity."

I have never ceased to believe how food unites people and cultures, as well as memories. As a child in Uzbekistan, the food was not only something that kept us alive every day but also a family, festivity, and identity. Since we used to exchange plov at holidays, I also knew at a young age that cooking is more than just a taste because it uses emotional and cultural contexts.\nThis has been enhanced after studying abroad. Since I live in a multicultural setting, I regularly observe how food establishes common ground as well as prompts people to feel related in humanity. I get a great sense of belonging whenever I prepare home-cooked meals, and is associated with knowing what and where I belong.\nCooking interests me as a recreational pursuit and I consider it as a platform where one can find identity by doing so. I like to share the traditional Uzbek dishes with the contemporary impact and trying dishes of another culture. As an academic, I am interested in learning how migration, language, and food can intersect to form personal and group identities. This course, Food, Language, and Identity, has taught me that cooking can be seen as a method of expression and cultural communication that can help people to cross the boundaries.",

Arjun Appadurai (1988) stresses the fact that national cuisines and food identities are not stable they are recreated with the migration, narration, and globalization.\nLanguage is also an important aspect in this. The manner in which individuals narrate meals, translate recipes or some culinary expressions illustrates the manner in which culture and identity are maintained or modified. Since Lisa Heldke (2003) argues in the context of cultural food adventurism, and bell Hooks (1992) offers criticism of the idea of representation, I got to understand that food may be a sign of empowerment or inequality, depending on who is telling the story.",

My interest tends to gravitate toward how people think, behave, and express identity, rather than toward the technical aspects of food production or agricultural systems.\n\nThroughout my academic journey, it gradually became clear to me that food can serve as a reflection of migration, belonging, and collective memory. Growing up in a multicultural environment exposed me to the subtle connections between language, daily practices, and the emotional significance of cooking and sharing meals. This perspective has led me to view food less as a product of industry and more as a medium through which individuals preserve traditions and form new cultural identities when recipes and languages move across borders.\n\nThis curiosity encouraged me to pay attention to processes such as globalization and cultural exchange, even if I do not approach them from an agrarian standpoint. I am more drawn to the psychological and social implications—how people adapt, what they choose to preserve, and how identity is communicated through food and storytelling. I also value creativity, collaboration, and learning from multiple viewpoints.

    "reflection": {
      "keyLearnings": "Cultural, social and economic practices of food are closely tied to identity, power and globalization theories. Structuralism is one of the central theoretical views that are shaped by Claude Levi-Strauss and claim that food practices mirror the more profound cultural structures. His well-known culinary triangle demonstrates the way in which societies make meaning by creating the difference between raw, cooked, and rotten that food is not merely nourishing, but is also symbolic.\n\nThe other theory is another major theory of symbolic interactionism which underlines how individuals and groups use food to create and define identity. Diet, religious food restrictions and family recipes are the markers of identity and otherness. Food is turned into an instrument of exercising ethnicity, gender, class, and national identity.\n\nThe foodways are also influenced by the power theories. The idea of power/knowledge by Michel Foucault can be used to understand how institutions like governments, corporations and health authorities regulate what people eat by means of regulation, marketing and discourse. Another theory about food preferences as the manifestation of social inequality is the theory about the habitus and cultural capital developed by Pierre Bourdieu. The preferences of specific cuisines may be the indicator of socioeconomic status and may support the divisions of classes.\n\nUnder the globalization concept, world-systems theory and political economy are employed by scholars to identify the manner in which global food chains establish unequal relationships between the rich consumer countries and the poor producer regions. Globalization diffuses cuisines across boundaries which results in hybrid food cultures but it is also a cause of concern regarding the homogenization of cultures and the disappearing food practices. The concept of gastro-politics presented by Appadurai puts emphasis on the fact that food is used as a location of negotiation, opposition, and cultural accommodation in the global flows.\n\nCombined, these theories demonstrate that foodways reflect how individuals create identities, exert power and maneuver in an increasingly globalized world.",

From family meals to community celebrations, I noticed early on that food is more than sustenance — it carries stories, traditions, and emotions.\n\nAs a child, I watched my family prepare traditional dishes such as plov and shurpa during holidays. These meals were moments of connection and cultural transmission, where recipes, stories, and laughter were shared across generations. Even as I traveled and studied abroad, I realized that food can bridge cultural differences, creating understanding between people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nCooking became a way for me to maintain my Uzbek identity while exploring other cultures. I enjoy experimenting with traditional dishes by adding contemporary influences and learning about cuisines from around the world. Academically, I am fascinated by how migration, globalization, and language intersect with culinary practices to shape both personal and collective identities.\n\nThis course, Food, Language, and Identity, has helped me understand that cooking and sharing food are forms of cultural communication. Food is a universal language, one that allows us to express memory, heritage, and connection (Mintz, 1985; Appadurai, 1988).",

      "keyLearnings": "Through this course, I learned that food is a system of cultural meaning that reflects relationships between identity, memory, and power. Mintz (1985) demonstrates that food practices are shaped by historical, economic, and social systems, influencing how communities identify themselves. Appadurai (1988) emphasizes that cuisines are dynamic and constantly evolving, shaped by migration, globalization, and cultural exchange.\n\nLanguage is equally important. How people describe meals, translate recipes, or share culinary stories shows how culture and identity are maintained or transformed. Heldke (2003) highlights the concept of cultural food adventurism, while hooks (1992) warns us to consider whose story is being told. These insights taught me that food is both a personal and political act, capable of empowerment or exclusion depending on context.\n\nBy studying these perspectives, I now understand that food is not just nourishment — it is a way to tell stories, share history, and build human connection.",
      "motto": "“Through food, we remember and belong.”",
      "applyingThemes": "I will apply the lessons from this course in both academic research and daily life. Academically, I aim to study how migrant communities use food and language to preserve cultural identity, especially across generations. I am particularly interested in how recipes, cooking practices, and culinary stories shared online or in families help sustain cultural memory.\n\nIn everyday life, I practice cultural curiosity and sharing. I try to learn the history and original names of dishes, share meals with friends from different backgrounds, and treat cooking as an act of communication, empathy, and identity-building.\n\nThis course has changed the way I view food: it is more than consumption — it is a medium to connect, remember, and express who we are. Through cooking, I feel both rooted in my heritage and open to the world."
