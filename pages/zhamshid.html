        <h2>Autobiography</h2>
        <p>
          I’m Zhamshid Abdulazizov, a student who grew up in Kazakhstan, where
          meals were as much about conversation and family rituals as about
          eating. I remember the long weekends when my family gathered around
          beshbarmak or baursaks, debating flavors, sharing stories, and
          sometimes playfully arguing over who added too much salt. From those
          moments, I realized that food is a lens for understanding people—what
          they value, how they remember, and how they connect. Cooking became my
          way to explore these dynamics personally: experimenting with
          traditional Kazakh dishes, introducing subtle twists, and seeing how
          friends respond. This curiosity led me to notice how recipes,
          ingredients, and preparation styles carry identity, memory, and social
          meaning.

          <h3>1. Key Learnings</h3>
          <p>
            One key lesson I took from this course is that food is a map of
            culture, identity, and power. I learned that globalization and
            migration don’t just spread dishes—they reshape them. A dish from
            Kazakhstan, for example, can appear differently abroad, acquiring
            new meanings while still carrying a trace of its origin. I also
            noticed how language frames food: the way people name dishes,
            describe flavors, or tell cooking stories preserves identity and
            transmits memory across generations. Understanding these patterns
            revealed that even everyday meals are embedded in larger social and
            cultural systems.

          <h3>2. Personal Motto</h3>
          <p>
            “Every dish carries a story.” This reminds me that cooking is more
            than technique; it’s communication. A family recipe, a street snack,
            or a holiday feast reflects history, relationships, and personal
            choices. Paying attention to these stories has deepened my
            appreciation for both my own roots and other cultures.

          <h3>3. Applying Course Themes</h3>
          <p>
            I plan to apply these insights by observing how people use food to
            express identity and memory. At home, I’ll pay attention to how
            recipes evolve across generations; in my academic work, I’ll explore
            how dishes travel and adapt while retaining cultural significance.
            Food, for me, will remain a way to connect with others, uncover
            hidden histories, and understand culture in its lived, flavorful
            form.
