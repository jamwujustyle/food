            Title: Kimchi-making (kimjang) as a Language of Memory among Korean
            Migrants
          </h2>
          <h3>Overview (short):</h3>
          <p>
            Kimchi and the communal practice of kimjang (seasonal kimchi-making)
            function as an embodied language of memory for Korean migrant
            communities. Beyond nutrition, kimchi-making transmits family
            histories, preserves Korean linguistic practices, and recreates
            social bonds in diasporic settings. When migrants adapt ingredients
            and techniques in host countries, the practice still sustains
            emotional continuity and cultural identity.

          <h2>Context & Background:</h2>
          <p>
            Kimchi is a traditional fermented vegetable dish central to Korean
            cuisine; kimjang — the large-scale seasonal preparation and sharing
            of kimchi — was inscribed on UNESCO’s Intangible Cultural Heritage
            list as a communal cultural practice that reinforces group identity
            and intergenerational transmission. In migration contexts (e.g.,
            Korean communities in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere),
            kimjang and everyday kimchi-making become sites where memory,
            language (Korean speech, recipe-terms, kinship terms), and identity
            are enacted and passed on.

          <h2>Key Findings:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Embodied memory:</strong> The sensory aspects of kimchi
              (smell, taste, texture) trigger family memories and act as
              non-verbal carriers of heritage.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Community spaces:</strong> Migrant women often create
              community kitchens or group kimjang events that recreate social
              life and provide a space for Korean-language use and storytelling.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Adaptation ≠ loss:</strong> Ingredient substitutions
              (local cabbage varieties, different peppers) are common, but
              adaptation itself becomes part of the migration narrative —
              recipes are altered yet meanings persist.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cultural translation:</strong> Kimchi-making can operate
              as “culinary storytelling” for host societies, helping migrants
              communicate identity and history through food-sharing and small
              food businesses.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

          <h2>Reflection:</h2>
          <p>
            This case confirms that home cooking operates as a language of
            memory in migration contexts. Kimchi and kimjang are not only
            culinary practices but social technologies that preserve language,
            ritual, and belonging. In diaspora, the collective work of preparing
            kimchi reconstructs social networks and offers a medium for
            intergenerational teaching; children learn cultural vocabulary and
            family stories not only by hearing them, but by tasting and
            participating. Importantly, adaptation to local ingredients shows
            resilience rather than erosion — the modified recipe becomes a
            narrative of movement and survival. For our project topic —
            Migration, Memory, and the Language of Home Cooking — this example
            illustrates how food-making communicates cultural memory and how
            such practices might be studied both ethnographically and through
            public engagement (community workshops, oral histories, and culinary
            storytelling events).
