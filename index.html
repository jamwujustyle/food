        <h1>Migration, Memory, and the Language of Home Cooking</h1>
        <p>
          A university research project exploring how culinary traditions serve
          as bridges between past and present, homeland and new home, preserving
          cultural identity through the universal language of food.

        <p class="reveal">
          Our project explores how migration shapes people's relationships with
          food, language, and cultural identity. When individuals or families
          move across borders, they carry their recipes, food memories, and
          cooking traditions with them. These traditions become a way to
          remember home and express belonging in new environments. Through our
          research, we examine how food acts as a bridge between past and
          present, and how the language of cooking—recipes, storytelling, and
          shared meals—preserves memory and identity.
        </p>
        <p class="reveal">
          We analyze academic perspectives on foodways, cultural memory, and
          globalization to understand how home cooking reflects both personal
          history and collective identity. By combining cultural theory with
          real examples of migrant food practices, our project highlights the
          emotional and linguistic power of food in shaping who we are.
          Ultimately, "Migration, Memory, and the Language of Home Cooking"
          celebrates food as a universal form of communication that connects
          people across time, place, and culture.
