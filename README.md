# Migration, Memory, and the Language of Home Cooking

## A University Research Project on Food, Culture, and Identity

---

### About This Project

This project explores the profound connections between **migration, memory, and the language of home cooking**. We delve into how culinary traditions serve as a powerful bridge, connecting individuals and communities to their past, their homeland, and their cultural identity, even when they are miles away from home.

When people move across borders, they carry more than just their belongings; they carry recipes, food memories, and cooking traditions that have been passed down through generations. These traditions become a vital way to remember home, express a sense of belonging in new environments, and preserve a unique cultural heritage.

Through our research, we examine how food acts as a universal language—a form of communication that transcends words. The simple act of cooking and sharing a meal becomes a way of telling stories, preserving history, and celebrating a shared identity.

### Key Themes Explored

- **Cultural Heritage:** How traditional foods preserve and transmit cultural values.
- **Identity & Belonging:** The role of cooking in shaping personal and collective identity.
- **Migration & Memory:** How food memories connect migrants to their roots and help them navigate new cultures.
- **The Language of Food:** Exploring recipes, storytelling, and shared meals as forms of cultural expression.
