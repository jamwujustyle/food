    "autobiography": "I’m Zhamshid Abdulazizov, a student who grew up in Kazakhstan, where meals were as much about conversation and family rituals as about eating. I remember the long weekends when my family gathered around beshbarmak or baursaks, debating flavors, sharing stories, and sometimes playfully arguing over who added too much salt. From those moments, I realized that food is a lens for understanding people—what they value, how they remember, and how they connect. Cooking became my way to explore these dynamics personally: experimenting with traditional Kazakh dishes, introducing subtle twists, and seeing how friends respond. This curiosity led me to notice how recipes, ingredients, and preparation styles carry identity, memory, and social meaning.",
    "reflection": {
      "keyLearnings": "One key lesson I took from this course is that food is a map of culture, identity, and power. I learned that globalization and migration don’t just spread dishes—they reshape them. A dish from Kazakhstan, for example, can appear differently abroad, acquiring new meanings while still carrying a trace of its origin. I also noticed how language frames food: the way people name dishes, describe flavors, or tell cooking stories preserves identity and transmits memory across generations. Understanding these patterns revealed that even everyday meals are embedded in larger social and cultural systems.",
      "motto": "“Every dish carries a story.” This reminds me that cooking is more than technique; it’s communication. A family recipe, a street snack, or a holiday feast reflects history, relationships, and personal choices. Paying attention to these stories has deepened my appreciation for both my own roots and other cultures.",
      "applyingThemes": "I plan to apply these insights by observing how people use food to express identity and memory. At home, I’ll pay attention to how recipes evolve across generations; in my academic work, I’ll explore how dishes travel and adapt while retaining cultural significance. Food, for me, will remain a way to connect with others, uncover hidden histories, and understand culture in its lived, flavorful form."

    "autobiography": "My name is Shaxodat Alimova, and I am a student with a strong interest in understanding how culture shapes the way people communicate, express identity, and connect with one another. Throughout my academic journey, I have become increasingly fascinated by how food tells stories about migration, belonging, and memory. Growing up in a multicultural environment has made me curious about the invisible ties between language and everyday practices such as cooking and eating.\nI enjoy exploring how people preserve their traditions through food and how new cultural identities emerge when recipes and languages travel across borders. This curiosity inspired me to study topics related to globalization and cultural exchange. Beyond academics, I value creativity, teamwork, and learning from different perspectives. I believe that food, like language, is a living form of expression that reflects who we are and where we come from. In the future, I hope to continue exploring cultural diversity and contribute to projects that promote cross-cultural understanding and respect through communication, storytelling, and education.",
    "reflection": {
      "keyLearnings": "One of the main lessons I have learned in this course is that food is not only a biological need but also a social and cultural language. Theories related to foodways helped me understand how food practices express identity and social relationships. I learned that what we eat, how we prepare it, and the words we use to describe it all reveal power structures and cultural histories. The concept of globalization showed how migration and cultural exchange influence food traditions—sometimes leading to hybrid cuisines or even cultural conflicts over authenticity. I also found the ideas about power important, especially how certain foods or cooking styles can be valued more because of social class, race, or colonial history.",
      "motto": "A guiding phrase I took from this course is: “Food is memory made visible.” This phrase reminds me that food is deeply emotional—it carries the stories of people, families, and places. Every recipe holds memories of migration, survival, and love. This idea is personally meaningful to me because food has always been a way for my family to stay connected to our cultural roots. It’s not only about taste, but also about remembering where we come from.",
      "applyingThemes": "I will apply what I learned about food, language, and identity by paying attention to how people express belonging through their cooking and storytelling. When migrants move to new countries, they often recreate traditional dishes as a way of keeping their culture alive. I want to explore how language is used in recipes, restaurant menus, and family conversations to preserve heritage and identity. In my future studies or career, I plan to continue examining how cultural exchange through food can build understanding between different communities. Food connects people beyond borders, and I believe that by studying these connections, we can promote empathy and appreciation for diversity."

    "autobiography": "Hello) I am Azimjon from Food Language and Identity. My name is Azimjon. I am senior Computer Science student at Webster. Despite technical nature of my major, I’ve always been interested in how food connects people to their culture and identity. After some time, I noticed how meals were more than just something to eat, they carried meaning, stories, and a sense of who we actually are. When I started learning about globalization and cultural exchange, I figured out that food travels and changes just like language does. One dish can show both history and adaptation, depending on who makes it and where.\nIn addition, my personal academic background helps me to see the foodways not just in traditions, I see them as systems of communication and even power. I enjoy studying or learning how recipes, taste, and cooking practices reveal something about society and relationships between people. Also, I like to cooking myself. For me it feels like a small act of keeping memory alive while at the same time also experimenting with new things. Overall, I see food as a way to understand both personal and global connections, and that’s why I’m drawn to studying it deeper.",
    "reflection": {
      "keyLearnings": "From this course, I’ve learned that food is simply nutrition, it’s a form of power, identity, and history. Some theories such as Bourdieu’s ideas of taste and Mintz’s work on sugar show and depict how food marks social class and historical exploitation. These readings helped me to understand that what people like eating and how they describe it reflects their position in systems of power and globalization.",
      "motto": "“Food is a language of belonging.” For me, it means that food speaks even when any sort of words fail. It tells who we are and where we come from, and it can also show how we find belonging in new places.",
      "applyingThemes": "I am planning to use what I learned about food, language, and identity in future projects or maybe even research. I’m especially very interested in how digital spaces can help preserve traditional food knowledge and share it across communities. Also, through writing, interviews, or storytelling, I want to explore how food can both protect culture and challenge inequality at the same time."

Four years ago I was a professional volleyball player; now I balance several tasks: coach and founder of my volleyball league and academy, service consultant at BYD, and student of computer science with keen interest in back-end development like Java, Go, PHP and AI automation. I like to teach kids volleyball, learning new skills, and explore the topics of sustainability, citizen journalism, and new challenges in the field of cybersecurity. Besides that, I am pursuing a master of Data Science and AI with the goal of Politecnico di Milano and still play volleyball and train in the gym. I am generally interested in sport, technology, sustainability and education: to me, it is necessary to unite the practice - on the court and with theory - in the classroom, creating something valuable to individuals and communities.",
    "reflection": {
      "keyLearnings": "During this course we have learned the intersections between foodways, the systematic patterns of the ways people obtain, prepare, share, and eat food, and identity, power, and globalization. Among the key theoretical lessons, the fact that food is not just biological sustenance, but a highly symbolic phenomenon must be mentioned: food creates cultural identity, expresses social status, strengthens group membership, and serves as a power terrain.\nWe also came to know how globalisation and migration are transforming food identities: food can travel, get mixed up, local food culture comes under the influence of global food culture, but food is also a place of resistance and belonging.",
      "motto": "What you eat speaks more than your diet - it tells your story.\nThis expression is a reminder to me that my personal background is not merely represented in what I do, but also in how I interact with culture, community and knowledge. Similar to food, there is memory, identity and power, and I envision my courses as a blend of various ingredients (volleyball, software, sustainability, education) into a significant recipe of difference.",
      "applyingThemes": "I have already experienced how culture, communication and identity relate through my volleyball league and academy and my role as a coach: children with different backgrounds gather, bring their food culture, their language, their methods of sharing. The knowledge of food, language and identity relationships assists me in creating inclusive settings in which diversity based on culture is celebrated. I will use this awareness in further software development (billing systems, management platforms) by designing tools that would take into account multilingual users, cultural variations, and social power relations (how access to food or sports training can be mediated by class or gender). In all my work as coach, consultant, student, I will be informed by the idea that our everyday practices (what we eat, how we share, how we talk, and so on) inform our identities and our power relations and therefore, designing wisely means knowing the cultural grid behind a simple act, such as having a meal."

    "autobiography": "My name is Asila Azizbekova, and I am a student deeply interested in the intersections of culture, identity, and communication. I was born and raised in Uzbekistan, a country whose cuisine reflects a mosaic of influences shaped by trade, migration, and shared memories. Growing up in such a culturally diverse environment made me realize how food is never just food — it is language, emotion, and memory blended into one.\n\nThroughout my academic journey, I have been fascinated by how people express belonging and nostalgia through what they cook and share. This curiosity led me to study the ways migration reshapes culinary traditions and how language preserves the emotional connection between people and their homeland.\n\nBeyond academics, I consider myself a creative and reflective person who enjoys exploring different art forms and finding meaning in small details of everyday life. Working on this project has been an opportunity to connect theory with lived experience — to see how the stories we tell through food become a part of who we are. I hope to continue studying global culture and communication, aiming to build bridges between people through understanding and shared human experiences.",
    "reflection": {
      "keyLearnings": "Throughout this course, I have come to understand how food operates not only as a means of survival but as a complex cultural language that carries identity, power, and memory. Theories of foodways and globalization helped me see that migration transforms not only where people live but also what and how they eat. For example, when families adapt recipes to new ingredients abroad, they preserve emotional roots while reshaping their identities. I realized that food often becomes a quiet resistance — a way for people to claim belonging when words fall short. The connections between food and power also became clear: who gets to define “authentic” cuisine, and whose traditions are overlooked, reveal deeper inequalities in global culture.",
      "motto": "“Every meal tells a story — of memory, movement, and meaning.”\nThis phrase resonates with me because it reminds me that food holds layers of history, emotion, and migration. It reflects the course’s spirit — to look beyond ingredients and recipes, and see the human stories beneath them. It also aligns with my personal belief that identity is something we taste and feel, not just describe.",
      "applyingThemes": "I plan to carry this understanding into my everyday life and future career. Whether in communication, cultural studies, or travel, I will approach food as a bridge that connects people beyond language barriers. This course taught me to listen to the “language” of food — how it expresses care, nostalgia, and resilience. When I encounter different cuisines, I will no longer see them as merely “foreign,” but as stories of migration, adaptation, and belonging.\nUltimately, this course has deepened my appreciation for diversity and human connection — showing that food is not only what we share on the table, but also what binds our memories and identities together."
