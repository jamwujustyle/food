        <h2>Autobiography</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Shaxodat Alimova, and I am a student with a strong interest
          in understanding how culture shapes the way people communicate,
          express identity, and connect with one another. Throughout my academic
          journey, I have become increasingly fascinated by how food tells
          stories about migration, belonging, and memory. Growing up in a
          multicultural environment has made me curious about the invisible ties
          between language and everyday practices such as cooking and eating.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy exploring how people preserve their traditions through food
          and how new cultural identities emerge when recipes and languages
          travel across borders. This curiosity inspired me to study topics
          related to globalization and cultural exchange. Beyond academics, I
          value creativity, teamwork, and learning from different perspectives.
          I believe that food, like language, is a living form of expression
          that reflects who we are and where we come from. In the future, I hope
          to continue exploring cultural diversity and contribute to projects
          that promote cross-cultural understanding and respect through
          communication, storytelling, and education.

          <h3>1. Key Learnings</h3>
          <p>
            One of the main lessons I have learned in this course is that food
            is not only a biological need but also a social and cultural
            language. Theories related to foodways helped me understand how food
            practices express identity and social relationships. I learned that
            what we eat, how we prepare it, and the words we use to describe it
            all reveal power structures and cultural histories. The concept of
            globalization showed how migration and cultural exchange influence
            food traditions—sometimes leading to hybrid cuisines or even
            cultural conflicts over authenticity. I also found the ideas about
            power important, especially how certain foods or cooking styles can
            be valued more because of social class, race, or colonial history.

          <h3>2. Personal Motto</h3>
          <p>
            A guiding phrase I took from this course is: “Food is memory made
            visible.” This phrase reminds me that food is deeply emotional—it
            carries the stories of people, families, and places. Every recipe
            holds memories of migration, survival, and love. This idea is
            personally meaningful to me because food has always been a way for
            my family to stay connected to our cultural roots. It’s not only
            about taste, but also about remembering where we come from.

          <h3>3. Applying Course Themes</h3>
          <p>
            I will apply what I learned about food, language, and identity by
            paying attention to how people express belonging through their
            cooking and storytelling. When migrants move to new countries, they
            often recreate traditional dishes as a way of keeping their culture
            alive. I want to explore how language is used in recipes, restaurant
            menus, and family conversations to preserve heritage and identity.
            In my future studies or career, I plan to continue examining how
            cultural exchange through food can build understanding between
            different communities. Food connects people beyond borders, and I
            believe that by studying these connections, we can promote empathy
            and appreciation for diversity.
